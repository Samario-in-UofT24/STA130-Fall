User: Explain how does the code below work, in English
Code:
# Markovian Chatbot

# from collections import defaultdict
word_used = dict() # defaultdict(int)
next_word = dict() # defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
for i,word in enumerate(words[:-1]):

    if word in word_used:
        word_used[word] += 1
    else:
        word_used[word] = 1
        next_word[word] = {}

    if words[i+1] in next_word[word]:
        next_word[word][words[i+1]] += 1
    else:
        next_word[word][words[i+1]] = 1

Assistant: 
This code is a simplified version of how a Markovian chatbot can work. It uses a Markov chain to predict the next word based on the current word.

1. `word_used = dict()`:
   - This dictionary keeps track of how many times each word appears in the given text.

2. `next_word = dict()`:
   - This dictionary tracks the possible next words for each word.

3. The `for` loop:
   - `enumerate(words[:-1])`: This loop iterates over the list `words`, which is presumably a sequence of words from the input text.

4. First `if` block:
   - If `word` is already in the `word_used` dictionary, its count is incremented.

5. Second `if` block:
   - The code checks if the next word (`words[i+1]`) has already been encountered after the current word.
   - If it has, the count of occurrences of that word pair is incremented.

In summary, this code builds a transition map of words and their likelihood of being followed by other words. 

User: Can you explain enumerate further
Assistant:
Certainly! The `enumerate()` function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to iterate over a sequence while also keeping track of the index of the current item.

### Syntax:
```python
enumerate(iterable, start=0)
```

### Example:
```python
words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for index, word in enumerate(words):
    print(index, word)
```
Output:
```
0 apple
1 banana
2 cherry
```

In your code, `enumerate(words[:-1])` creates an iterator that gives both the index `i` and the corresponding word from the `words` list.
