User: I will provide you some code of Markovian ChatBot. At the same time I will give you the extension of the code. Explain the code to me, considering about their function. All the answers should be in English.
Assistant: Sure! Please go ahead and provide the code and any extensions you want me to explain. I'll walk you through their functions in detail.

User: # Markovian Chatbot
# from collections import defaultdict
word_used = dict() # defaultdict(int)
next_word = dict() # defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
for i,word in enumerate(words[:-1]):

    if word in word_used:
        word_used[word] += 1
    else:
        word_used[word] = 1
        next_word[word] = {}

    if words[i+1] in next_word[word]:
        next_word[word][words[i+1]] += 1
    else:
        next_word[word][words[i+1]] = 1

# Markovian Chatbot Extension #2
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
# `avatar` is a dataset, and `character` is one of it's columns
characters = Counter("\n"+ avatar.character.str.upper().str.replace(' ','.')+":")
# this code changes the type of the `character` column to `str`; then,
# makes the text uppercase, and replaces spaces with '.'

nested_dict = lambda: defaultdict(nested_dict)
word_used2C = nested_dict()
next_word2C = nested_dict()

for i,word in enumerate(words[:-2]):
    if word in characters:
        character = word
        
    if character not in word_used2C:
        word_used2C[character] = dict()
    if word+' '+words[i+1] not in word_used2C[character]:
        word_used2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]] = 0
    word_used2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]] += 1
    
    if character not in next_word2C:
        next_word2C[character] = dict()
    if word+' '+words[i+1] not in next_word2C[character]:
        next_word2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]] = dict()
    if words[i+2] not in next_word2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]]:
        next_word2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]][words[i+2]] = 0
    next_word2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]][words[i+2]] += 1

Assistant: Let's go step by step to explain the code and its extensions:

1. **Markovian Chatbot (Original Code)**
This part of the code aims to generate a Markovian model where each word predicts the next word based on a given input sequence of words.
...

User: Can you explain how does Markov model work in the code here
Assistant: The code you provided implements a **Markov model**, which is a statistical model used to predict the next state (in this case, the next word) based on the current state (the current word or word pair). In this context, the model assumes that the next word only depends on the current word (or word pair) and not on the entire history of the conversation.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how the **Markov model** is used in the code:
